# Rendering Exercises

The code in this repository is meant to practice rendering object data using JS template literals.

## Takeaways

- I now have a pretty good grasp on template literals
- Now that we have reviewed using multiple functions to split up the work, I could go back and review them again
- I generally feel more comfortable with JS logic and as a result, I'd procrastinate on the styling
